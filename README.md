# A Computationally Efficient Neural Network Invariant to the Action of Symmetry Subgroups

This repository contains the code associated with the paper ["A Computationally Efficient Neural Network Invariant to the Action of Symmetry Subgroups"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07528).

### Short description
This repository contains implementation of the G-invariant neural networks.
Those networks are able to approximate functions invariant to the action of a given subgroup G
of the symmetric group on the input data.
The key element of the proposed network architecture is a new G-invariant transformation module,
which produces a G-invariant latent representation of the input data.
This latent representation is then processed with a multi-layer perceptron in the network.
